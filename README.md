# Gravitational-Glitch-Classification
The data provided contains information about the type of gravitational glitch a non-Gaussian noise transient is detected. A high occurrence rate for these glitches in data can endanger the data we use for finding gravitational waves. There are 22 types of glitches in the data, for which we are trying to prepare a model that can classify these glitches.
